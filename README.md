# Z80-Retro! Project Setup

The software and hardware for this project can be developed on a Raspberry PI or similar Unix/Linux system.

*Note that this project only uses a PI to program the boot flash using the In System Flash Programmer.  But that can be done with a stand-alone programmer if you are familiar with doing so.*
